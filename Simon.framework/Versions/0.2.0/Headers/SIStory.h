/**
 The story is the heart of BDD. This class encapsulates the information for one specific story. It stores a list of the steps that 
 the story has and also provides functionality for communicating between steps. SISteps can map to a single class or several classes which means you can have a clean seperation between step methods that are specific to you story and methods that are more generic. Because the classes which contain the step methods are actually instantiated, it amkes it possible to pass values from one step method to another by using a class property. However SIStory also provides methods that access a story based object cache so it's possible to pass objects between methods on completely different classes.
 
 When a SIStoryRunner executes a story, it sources a list of SIStepMapping instances from the SIRuntime class. it then passes these to the story and:
 
 - Loops through each SIStep and passes it the list of mappings to see if any match.
 - If all steps are mapped, then loop through again:
	- Checks a local cache to see if we have an instance of the class that has been mapped to the step. If not creates one and stores it.
	- Passes the instance of the mapping class to the step and asks it to invoke the step method on it.
 - Returns the fial status to the SIStoryRunner.
 
 Steps implementations which have been mapped by the SIStepMapping class
 can come from more than just one class. Therefore this class also provides a cache in which you can store objects which you want to use across more than one instance.
